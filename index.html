    <p>I go in for sports, I like to play tennis. I go to play tennis every day.
Sport is very important part of our life. Many people go in for sports, they jogging, walking, swimming, skating, skiing, train themselves in clubs and different sections.
Physical training is an important subject at school. Pupils play volleyball, football, basketball.I have been playing tennis for 5 years. Tennis became very popular now. I take part in different competitions. In present days I do not go to tennis as much as in the past but if I have free time tennis court is the first place where i go.<br>
